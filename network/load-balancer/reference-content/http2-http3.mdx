## HTTP overview

The **H**yper**t**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol, providing the foundations of data exchange and transfer on the web. As a request-response protocol, the client (usually a web browser) requests certain data (e.g. the files needed to display a webpage) from a server, which transfers the requested data in response.

## HTTP/1

Development of the first version of the HTTP protocol, HTTP/1, began in 1989. It was finalized and fully documented by the [IETF](todolink) in 1996, with its specifications updated in 1999, 2014 and 2022. 

## HTTP/2

HTTP/2 was released in 2015. It was designed to be a more efficient version of HTTP, fixing some of HTTP/1's performance issues, and moving from a text based protocol to a binary protocol. This is easier to parse for clients and servers, helps avoid errors and allows multiplexing. Over [40% of websites now use HTTP/2/](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-http2), and it is supported by [97% of web browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=http2).

HTTP/2 improves upon HTTP/1's performance in many ways:
- **Increased efficiency via use of binary framing**. HTTP/1 uses text-based data transfer, which can be long, bandwidth-heavy and error-prone. HTTP/2 uses binary message framing, which is more compact and efficient so easier to parse, and provokes fewer errors.
- **Solves blocking problem via multiplexing**: HTTP/1 has a **H**ead **O**f **L**ine (HOL) blocking problem, where over a single TCP connection the browser must wait for its existing requests to be completely answered before it can make a new request. HTTP/2 solves this with multiplexing: the ability to make multiple requests in parallel over a single TCP connection. 
- **Reduced overhead with header compression**: 
    Header compression – HTTP/2 uses header compression to reduce the overhead caused by TCP’s slow-start mechanism.
    Server push – HTTP/2 servers push likely-to-be-used resources into a browser’s cache, even before they’re requested. This allows browsers to display content without additional request cycles.
    Increased security – Web browsers only support HTTP/2 via encrypted connections, increasing user and application security.


## HTTP/3

HTTP/3 was published in 2022. It uses QUIC as its underlying transport protocol, in contrast with HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 which use TCP. [25% of websites use HTTP/3](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-http3) and is supported by most major web browsers, representing over 75% of users.
